#Terminal Revolution
##Facing Problems:
1. Nowadays, chip technology is approaching physical limits, and the improvement in individual performance is limited.
2. Battery technology is developing slowly.
3. Personal terminals are limited in terms of size and weight, with limited room for improvement.
4. Emerging industries such as artificial intelligence, VR, AR, etc., have higher requirements for hardware and software.
5. The future will see rapid growth in data, such as high-definition images, videos, lossless audio, etc.
6. Terminals such as computers, mobile phones, tablets, and other smart devices require similar hardware, only with different front-end displays.
7. There are common software and hardware requirements for individuals, families, communities, schools, enterprises, etc., such as computing resources (CPU, GPU), caching resources (memory, cache), storage resources (hard disks, magnetic tapes), etc., providing a foundation for integration.
8. Pure cloud-based solutions have high requirements for software, hardware, and communication.

##Solution:
###Similar to the development of web architecture from single machines to distributed clusters, we need to design a distributed cluster terminal to integrate and schedule information resources, maximize the 1. 1. utilization efficiency of hardware resources, and accelerate the development of new industries such as artificial intelligence, AR, VR, etc.
1. The scale of terminal demand ranges from homes to cities.
2. Terminal hardware is divided into clusters based on functional modules, such as computing clusters, caching clusters, storage clusters, connected through high-speed communication buses.
3. Centralized handling of cooling, backup, and power supply for terminals.
4. Terminals, central terminals, and cloud terminals are interconnected through high-speed networks.
5. Subdivisions within terminal clusters, such as solid-state and mechanical, CPU, and GPU, etc.
6. Terminal operating systems should also be designed as distributed systems, such as scheduling modules, permission modules, communication modules, device modules, etc.
7. Terminal operating systems support the expansion of software and hardware.
8. Strict data protection and permission management in terminal operating systems.
9. Central storage of public data, such as audio, video, images, etc., private storage in terminals, and all storage in the cloud.
10. Software services on terminals.
11. Development of various protocols.
12. Terminals should retain certain basic applications in the early stages, such as call handling and SMS capabilities, and consider whether they can be developed into input + communication + display capabilities in the future.
13. Terminal systems should be standardized, themed, and personalized, allowing users to choose different themes and personalized settings based on their preferences and needs.
14. High-speed network connection between terminal and central terminal for real-time data transmission and response.
15. Terminal operating systems support the expansion of software and hardware, allowing the addition of different hardware devices and software services as needed.
16. Central storage of public data, such as audio, video, images, etc., private storage in terminals, and all storage in the cloud to ensure data security and reliability.
17. Software services on terminals, providing commonly used software functions as services, allowing users to subscribe and use as needed.
18. Development of various protocols to ensure interoperability and compatibility between different devices and systems.
19. Terminals retain certain basic applications, such as call handling and SMS capabilities, and consider developing terminals into input + communication + display platform in the future to improve user experience and functionality.
